# Python-Learing-Notes
The material for CSC1002 Tutorials (Guochao Xie) at CUHK(SZ), 2020 Spring. 

# Installation

You need _jupyter notebook_ to run the notebooks. You may follow [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

I suggest installing [Jupyter Contrib Nbextensions](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) as well to improve your coding efficiency with Jupyter Notebook. You'd better enable the following extensions:

1. Table of Contents
2. Exercise2
